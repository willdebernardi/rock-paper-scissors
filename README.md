This is a console version of Rock Paper Scissors, the first Javascript project from The Odin Project. With this project I learned quite a lot about scope, as well as how function return values are handled.

Future goals: 
1. Refactor the win checking to be more elegant than 9 if statements
~~2. Build UI~~
2. Make it less ugly

Update (1/20/21): 

I continued this project by adding a very simple UI, and in doing so learned a lot about DOM manipulation through JS.
